      <!-- Bio -->
      <div>
        <p>
          My name is David Dyer, I am an artist, skateboarder, music label
          co-founder, and eCommerce professional, making strides toward a career
          in UX Design & frontend web development. Born in Baton Rouge,
          Louisiana, our family moved to Central Florida where I got heavy into
          digital video production and DJ'ing. Eventually, my friends and I
          launched a record label dubbed Prestige Music Group, still running
          today. In '07, I graduated from the University of Central Florida with
          a BA in Entrepreneurship. It was not long after graduation that I
          relocated myself to sunny Los Angeles CA.<span id="dots">...</span
          ><br /><br />
          <span id="fullBio"
            >In early '09, I gained an entry-level position with famed LA
            apparel brand, The Hundreds. Within one year, I was promoted to
            eCommerce Sales Manager. As the years went on, the collections and
            warehouse teams grew in size, as did the responsibilities merging
            into digital marketing, merchandising, logistics, 3PL, the list goes
            on. After years of building trust with executives, I was able to
            position myself into a vital part of our web development team. My
            input was largely considered with respect to building out
            functionality for multiple website redesigns and platform
            migrations. I believe this experience planted the seed that later
            grew into aspirations for a career in UX Design.<br /><br />
            In 2018 I ventured up to the Bay Area, landing in Oakland. There, I
            joined up with community apparel brand Oaklandish as Operations
            Specialist, working to establish and manage multiple sub-label web
            shops, integrated sales channels, and help facilitate the start of
            their partnership with the Oakland Roots Soccer Club. Soon I decided
            to further my education by earning certification as a UX Designer
            from UCBerkeley.<br /><br />
            Enter COVID. I have relocated once again, now residing just outside
            of Atlanta GA. Lately, you can find me offering freelance design
            services while enrolled at GA Tech coding bootcamp for the fall
            term, putting all the pieces together. Reach out, get in touch, and
            let's start a project together!</span
