      <p>
        My name is David Dyer, I am an artist, skateboarder, music label
        co-founder, and eCommerce professional, making strides toward a career
        in UX Design & frontend web development. Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
        our family moved to Central Florida where I got heavy into digital video
        production and DJ'ing. Eventually, my friends and I launched a record
        label dubbed Prestige Music Group, still running today. In '07, I
        graduated from the University of Central Florida with a BA in
        Entrepreneurship. It was not long after graduation that I relocated
        myself to sunny Los Angeles CA.<br /><br />
        In early '09, I gained an entry-level position with famed LA apparel
        brand, The Hundreds. Within one year, I was promoted to eCommerce Sales
        Manager. As the years went on, the collections and warehouse teams grew
        in size, as did the responsibilities merging into digital marketing,
        merchandising, logistics, 3PL, the list goes on. After years of building
        trust with executives, I was able to position myself into a vital part
        of our web development team. My input was largely considered with
        respect to building out functionality for multiple website redesigns and
        platform migrations. I believe this experience planted the seed that
        later grew into aspirations for a career in UX Design.<br /><br />
        In 2018 I ventured up to the Bay Area, landing in Oakland. There, I
        joined up with community apparel brand Oaklandish as Operations
        Specialist, working to establish and manage multiple sub-label web
        shops, integrated sales channels, and help facilitate the start of their
        partnership with the Oakland Roots Soccer Club. Soon I decided to
        further my education by earning certification as a UX Designer from
        UCBerkeley.<br /><br />
        Enter COVID. I have relocated once again, now residing just outside of
        Atlanta GA. Lately, you can find me offering freelance design services
        while enrolled at GA Tech coding bootcamp for the fall term, putting all
        the pieces together. Reach out, get in touch, and let's start a project
        together!
